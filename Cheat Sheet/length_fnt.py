# Here we are learning the len() function to find the length of a string
name = input("What is your name? \n")
length = len(name)
print("The length of the your name is: ", length)

# Here we do the same code but with shortest possible code length
print("The length of your name is: ", len(input("What is Your Name?\n")))
# But here in this code we don't store any values
